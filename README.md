# Beginning ML Tutorial: Iris Flowers
[This](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) is a tutorial
that I went ahead and followed to start practicing with Machine Learning in Python.

The [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) website seems to have a great
deal in knowing and understanding a lot when it comes to Machine Learning.

### Questions
As is inevitable, I have plenty of questions (for myself) in understanding what I can about
Machine Learning. I am listing the questions that I have down below in a bullet list, and hope
to eventually answer the questions with an indented bullet for myself.

OUTPUT QUESTIONS:
* What is a sepal?
* What is a class, when it comes to flowers?
* What is an iris-setosa? Iris-versicolor? Iris-virginica?
* What are [LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB, SVM]?
* What is a precision?
* What is a recall?
* What is an f1-score?
